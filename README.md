Description:  ImgSpot is an application that provides a way for users to share and collect images with other 
users. Users can upload personal image files as well as share and comment on images that other users upload. 
Technologies utilized in ImgSpot are ASP.Net MVC and Angular for generating UI functionality and Entity-
Framework to interact with the database of images. The server side language leverages SQL Server and 
Microsoft Azure to host the database. Image and comment processing is handled with the Azure Cognitive 
Services API because it will also filter photos and comments.
